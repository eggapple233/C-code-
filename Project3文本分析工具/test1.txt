The Influence of Mind over Body
Mind is essential for the well-being of body and mind.Research indicates that individuals with a positive mindset typically maintain good health, while those with negative thoughts tend to encounter bodily issues. Indeed the fact is true, a man's body is adjusted by his mind to a large extent.
 The influence of mind over body is various. First of all, mind can affect people's health. Numerous studies indicate that the digestive system is associated with the brain, and if emotions like depression or grief interferes with this, the individual's likelihood of developing disease is greater. That's because mind-people's mood or emotions- can influence the function of body through some hormones. It certainly illustrates the point that there is a close relationship between mind and body. Almost all the people have experienced this before: He cannot feel the exhaustion and pain when he was trying his best to get the goat, even through he was hurt, after that he would start to realize how painful or tired he was. It is mind that prevents him from pain or other bad feelings by controlling body to produce a hormone called adrenaline. What's more, mind can even help body to overcome the illness. Just like some news reports, sometimes there are some patients who suffer from cancer and doctors think they could not survive while they have an optimistic attitude and eventually overcome the cancer. Despite the inability of experts to determine what occurred, people believe that the mind can have a significant impact on the body.
 To a conclusion, body is inseparable from mind since mind can influence the body in many aspects. People need to control their mind and stay optimistic in order to stay healthy.
